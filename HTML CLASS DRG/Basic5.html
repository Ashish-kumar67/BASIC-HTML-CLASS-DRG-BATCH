<!-- Storing Images on Your Site -->
<!-- it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses. -->

<!-- Adding Image -->
<!--  
To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty 
element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes: -->

<!--
src : This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This 
will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your 
own site.   -->

<!-- alt : This provides a text description of the image which describes the 
image if you cannot see it.
-->

<!-- title :You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element 
to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers 
will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image -->

<img src="no image for now" alt="A family of 
 quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian marsupial that is similar in size to the domestic cat." />

<!-- Figure and Figure Caption -->
<!-- images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new <figure> element to 
contain images and their caption so that the two are associated. 
You can have more than one image inside the <figure> element as long as they all share 
the same caption. -->

<!-- The <figcaption> element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add 
a caption to an image. Before these elements were created there was no way to 
associate an <img> element with its caption -->
