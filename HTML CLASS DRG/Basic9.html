<!-- The <video> element has a number of attributes which allow you to control video playback: -->
<!-- src : This attribute specifies the path to the video. 

    poster : This attribute allows you to specify an image to show while the video is downloading or until 
    the user tells the video to play.

    width, height :These attributes specify the size of the player in pixels.

    controls : When used, this attribute indicates that the browser should supply its own controls 
    for playback.

    autoplay : When used, this attribute specifies that the file should play automatically.

    loop : When used, this attribute indicates that the video should start playing again once it has 
    ended.

    HTML5: Adding Video to Your PagesIn HTML5 you do not need to 
    supply values for all attributes, such as the controls, autoplay, 
    and loop attributes used with the <video> element. 

    These attributes are like on/off switches. If the attribute is present, it turns that option on. 
    If the attribute is omitted, the option is turned off. 

    If the browser does not  the <video> element or the format of video used, 
    it will display whatever is between the opening <video>and closing </video> tags.

    preload :This attribute tells the browser what to do when the page loads.
     It can have one of three 
    values: 
    none -> The browser should not load the video until the user presses play.
    auto -> The browser should download the video when the page loads.
    metadata ->The browser should just collect information such as the size, first frame,
    track list, and duration -->
