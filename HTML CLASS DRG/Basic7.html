<!-- forms -->
<!-- A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server. -->
<!-- Form Structure -->

<!-- Form controls live inside a <form> element. This element should always carry the action
attribute and will usually have a method  too.

action :Every <form> element requires an action attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the 
server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.

method : Forms can be sent using one of  two methods: get or post -->

<form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php" method="get">
  <p>This is where the form controls will appear.</p>
</form>

<hr />

<!-- Text Input -->
<!-- The <input> element is used to create several different form 
controls. The value of the typeattribute determines what kind of input they will be creating -->

<!-- type="text" When the type attribute has a value of text, it creates a singleline text input. -->

<!-- name :When users enter information into a form, the server needs to 
know which form control each piece of data was entered into.  -->

<!-- size : The size attribute should not be used on new forms. It was used in older forms to indicate 
the width of the text input -->

<!-- maxlength : You can use the maxlength attribute to limit the number 
of characters a user may enter into the text field. -->

<form action="">
  <p>
    Username size -> 15 and maxlength =30 :
    <input type="text" name="username" size="15" maxlength="30" />
  </p>
</form>

<hr />

<!-- type="password" -> hides the input data like password should do. -->
<form action="">
  <p>
    Username:
    <input type="text" name="username" size="15" maxlength="30" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Password:
    <input type="password" name="password" size="15" maxlength="30" />
  </p>
</form>
<hr />

<!-- Text area -->
<!-- The <textarea> element  is used to create a mutli-line text input. -->
<!-- placeholder can be added instead  of  a prewritten value  -->
<form action="">
  <p>What did you think of this gig?</p>
  <textarea name="comments" cols="20" rows="4" >Enter  your comments...</textarea>
</form>

<hr />

<!-- type="radio" -->

<!-- name :The name attribute is sent to the server with the value of the option the user selects.
the name in all the options should be same if they are options for one field. -->

<!-- value : The value attribute indicates the value that is sent to the server for the selected option.  -->

<!-- checked : The checked attribute can be used to indicate which value (if any) should be selected when 
the page loads. -->

<form action="">
  <p>
    Please select your favorite genre:
    <br />
    <input type="radio" name="genre" value="rock" checked="checked" /> Rock
    <input type="radio" name="genre" value="pop" />
    Pop
    <input type="radio" name="genre" value="jazz" />
    Jazz
  </p>
</form>

<hr />

<!-- type="checkbox" -->
<!-- name , value , checked is same as radio just the difference is that we can select multiple value 
for same name . -->
<form action="">
  <p>
    Please select your favorite music service(s):
    <br />
    <input
      type="checkbox"

    <input type="checkbox" name="service" value="spotify" /> Spotify
  </p>
</form>

<hr />

<!-- Drop Down List Box -->
<!-- A drop down list box (also known as a select box) allows users to select one option from a 
drop down list.  -->
<!-- The <select> element is used to create a drop down list box. 
It contains two or more <option> elements. -->

<!-- name is similar the difference is that we only have to mention one time for multiple values as options -->
<!-- value is also similar to checkbox or radio and selected attribute is like checked that we saw earlier -->

<form action="">
  <p>What device do you listen to music on?</p>
  <select name="devices">
    <option value="ipod" selected="selected">iPod</option>
    <option value="radio">Radio</option>
    <option value="computer">Computer</option>
  </select>
</form>

<hr />

<!-- size :You can turn a drop down select box into a box that shows more 
      than one option by adding the size attribute. -->

<!-- multiple : You can allow users to select multiple options from this list by 
           adding the multiple attribute with a value of multiple.  -->

<form action="">
  <p>
    Do you play any of the following instruments? (You can select more than one
    option by holding down control on a PC or command key on a Mac while
    selecting different options.)
  </p>
  <select name="instruments" size="3" multiple="multiple">
    <option value="guitar" selected="selected">Guitar</option>

    <option value="bass">Bass</option>
  </select>
</form>

<!-- File Input Box -->
<!-- type="file" -->
<!-- This type of input creates a box that looks like a text input followed by a browse button. 
When the user clicks on the browse button, a window opens up that allows them to select a 
file from their computer to be uploaded to the website. -->

<!-- When you are allowing users to upload files, the method attribute on the <form> element 
must have a value of post. (You cannot send files using the HTTP get method.) -->

<!-- When a user clicks on the browse button, the presentation of the window that allows 
them to browse for the file they want to upload will match the windows of the user's operating 
system. You cannot control the appearance of these windows. -->

<form action="" method="post">
  <p>Upload your song in MP3 format:</p>
  <input type="file" name="user-song" /><br />
  <input type="submit" value="Upload" />
</form>

<hr />

<!-- Submit Button -->

<!-- type="submit" -->
<!-- The submit button is used to send a form to the server. -->
<!-- name : It can use a name attribute but it does not need to have one. -->

<!-- value : The value attribute is used to control the text that appears on a button. 
It is a good idea to specify the words you want to appear on a button because the 
default value of buttons on some browsers is ‘Submit query’ and this might not be appropriate for 
all kinds of form. -->
<form action="">
  <p>Subscribe to our email list:</p>
  <input type="text" name="email" />
  <input type="submit" name="subscribe" value="Sub" />
</form>
<hr />

<!-- Button & hidden Controls -->

<!-- type="hidden" -->
<!-- This example also shows a hidden form control. These form controls are not shown on the 
page (although you can see them if you use the View Source option in the browser). 
if you remove hidden in type by default it will take type text and will be visible-->

<!-- They allow web page authors to add values to forms that users cannot see. 
For example, a web page author might use a hidden field to indicate 
which page the user was on when they submitted a form. -->

<form action="">
  <button>
    <img
      src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/animation/2022/08/02/02/49/02-49-08-258_512.gif"
      alt="Download"
      width="50"
      height="50"
    />
    Download
  </button>
  <input type="hidden" name="bookmark" value="lyrics" />
</form>

<hr />

<!-- Labelling Form Controls -->

<!-- The <label> element can be used in two ways. 
It can:
1. Wrap around both the text description and the form input (as shown on the first line of the 
  example to your right).

2. Be kept separate from the form control and use the for attribute to indicate which form 
  control it is a label for (as shown with the radio buttons). -->

<label>Age: <input type="text" name="age" /></label>
<br />
Gender:
<input id="female" type="radio" name="gender" value="f" />
<label for="female">Female</label>
<input id="male" type="radio" name="gender" value="m" />
<label for="male">Male</label>

<hr />

<!-- Grouping Form Elements -->

<!-- You can group related form controls together inside the <fieldset> element. -->
<!-- This is particularly helpful for longer forms.
Most browsers will show the fieldset with a line around 
the edge to show how they are related. The appearance of these 
lines can be adjusted using CSS. -->

<!-- The <legend> element can come directly after the opening <fieldset> tag 
and contains a caption which helps identify the purpose of that group of form controls. -->

<form action="">
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Contact details</legend>
    <label>Email:<br />
      <input type="text" name="email" /></label><br />
    <label>Mobile:<br />
      <input type="text" name="mobile" /></label><br />
    <label>Telephone:<br />
      <input type="text" name="telephone"/></label>
  </fieldset>
</form>

<!-- HTML5: Form Validation -->

<!-- You have probably seen forms on the web that give users messages if the form control has 
not been filled in correctly; this is known as form validation. -->

<!-- Traditionally, form validation has been performed using JavaScript (which is beyond the scope of this book).
But HTML5 is introducing validation and leaving the work to the browser. -->
<form action=""method="post"> 
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" name="username" required="required" /></title><br /> 
<label for="password">Password:</label>
<input type="password" name="password" required="required" /> <br>
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>

<hr>

<!-- type="date" -->
<!-- the appearance of this input field depends on browser  -->
<form action="" method="post">
<label for="username">Departure date:</label>
<input type="date" name="depart" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
<hr>

<!-- Email & URL Input -->

<!-- type="email" : Browsers that support HTML5 validation will check that the user has provided 
information in the correct format of an email address-->

<!-- type="url" :  HTML5 validation will check that the user has provided 
information in the format of a URL -->

<form action=""> 
  <p>Please enter your email address:</p>
  <input type="email" name="email" />
  <p>Please enter your website address:</p>
