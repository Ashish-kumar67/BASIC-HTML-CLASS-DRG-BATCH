<!-- ID Attribute : more like roll number of student unique for each student  -->

<!-- Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element 
from other elements on the page. Its value should start with 
a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character).
It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id
attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique) -->
<p id="pullquote">para with id</p>
<p>para with no id</p>

<hr />

<!-- class attribute -> like real class multiple student can be part of it  -->

<!-- Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a 
way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page. -->

<!-- we can include a element to mulyiple classes seperated by space -->

<p class="important">para with class = important</p>
<p>para with no calss</p>
<p class="important good">para with class = important and good</p>

<!-- Block Elements -->
<!-- takes new line every time -->
<!-- Examples of block elements are <h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>. -->
<h1>heading</h1>
<p>para</p>
<ul>
  <li>list item 1</li>
  <li>list item 2</li>
  <li>list item 3</li>
  <li>list item 4</li>
</ul>

<!-- Inline elements -->

<!-- Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements.
These are known as inline elements. -->
<!-- Examples of inline elements are <a>, <b>, <em>, and <img> -->

random things <em> em tag </em> again random things and <b> bold tag </b>.

<!-- Grouping Text & Elements In a Block -->

<!-- The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box -->
<!-- then we can style this box seperately -->
<div id="header">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="biography.html">Biography</a></li>
    <li><a href="works.html">Works</a></li>
    <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
<hr />

<!-- Grouping Text & Elements Inline -->

<!-- The <span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the <div>element.

It is used to either:
1. Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate
   it from its surrounding text.

2. Contain a number of inline elements The most common reason why people use <span> elements 
  is so that they can control the appearance of the content of these elements using CSS. -->

<p>para starts <span class="gallery"> span comes </span> para ends</p>
